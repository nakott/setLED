# setLED

setLED is a tiny program to control the [LoDi-Light-Operator 4-C-LED](https://www.lokstoredigital.de/hardware/schalten/lodi-operator-4-c-led/) connected at a [LoDi-Shift-Commander](https://www.lokstoredigital.de/hardware/schalten/lodi-shift-commander/). It has been developed to set the time and to set the effects out of model railroad computer control programm TrainController™.  Syntax and usage of setLED is described in setLED.java. 

setLED does not check the input parameters at all. Wrong usage will end up in a java exception. 

To run setLED hidden out of TrainController™, you can use the program [RunHidden.exe](https://www.robvanderwoude.com/csharpexamples.php#RunHidden). Otherwise you will see a black command window while setLED is executed.
